# BASH SCRIPTS
Bash scripts I use for automating small stuff because I'm lazy

### To use with nautilus
Paste scripts to /home/yourUserName/.local/share/nautilus/scripts

### To use with nemo
Paste scripts to /home/yourUserName/.local/share/nemo/scripts

Note: Make sure to make all the scripts executales
